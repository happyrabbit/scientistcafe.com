<p>ASA Statistics on Marketing will hold monthly online workshop on topics at data science in marketing.
It will be online using Google Hangouts On Air. See information for our previous and
future workshops at: <a href="http://scientistcafe.com/">http://scientistcafe.com/</a>.  Welcome to join ASA Statistics in Marketing
<a href="http://community.amstat.org/statisticsinmarketingsection/home">here</a>.</p>

<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to make authoring content easy for everyone. Rather than writing complex
 markup code (e.g. LyX, XML, HTML or LaTeX), Markdown enables the use of a syntax much more like plain-text email.
 It is young comparing to the other markup languages. What makes markdown distinct is that it is both machine-readble
 and human-readble.</p>

<p>R Markdown combines the core syntax of markdown and embedded R code chunks that are run so their output can be
included in the final document. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and the most important, it is simple!</p>

<p>In this talk, Yihui will talk about some new powerful and beautiful packages in the ecosystem of R Markdown
which make our analytical life much easier!</p>
